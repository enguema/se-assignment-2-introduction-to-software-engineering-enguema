# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering consists of the application of a systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that encompasses all aspects of
software production from the initial stages of system specification to maintaining the
system after it is used.That is to say, software engineering covers all phases of the
software life cycle; planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing and
maintenance.
Unlike traditional programming, software engineering came to solve the set of
difficulties or errors in planning, cost estimation, productivity and quality in the
production of software typical of traditional programming.


Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
The software development life cycle is made up of the following phases:
1. Identification of the problem: aims to correctly identify the problems or needs
that the institution has, the opportunities and objectives. The result of this
phase is a feasibility report, which contains the definition of the problem and
summarizes the objectives.
2. Determination of information requirements: In this phase, the needs of the
users involved are determined, understanding the way in which they interact
in the work context with their current information systems.
3. Analysis of system needs: in this phase the systems analyst prepares a
proposal in which he summarizes everything he has found out about the
current information system; may include a cost-benefit analysis of alternatives
and, if required, makes recommendations.
4. Recommended system design: consists of making a logical design of system
procedures using the information collected in previous phases, which will allow
users to enter data accurately.
5. Software development and documentation: consists of developing the
required software. Effective documentation for the software is also made in
this phase, including procedure manuals, online help, and frequently asked
questions (FAQ) websites.
6. System testing and maintenance: It consists of performing functional tests with
test data, which would help detect problems before delivering the system to
users. System maintenance and documentation of this maintenance begins in
this phase and is carried out routinely throughout the life of the information
system.
7. System implementation and evaluation: consists of implementing the created
information system and training users for its use in production.


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of collecting, analyzing and verifying customer
needs for software. In this process, five fundamental tasks or stages can be identified;
problem recognition, evaluation and synthesis, modeling, specification, review.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the property that allows an application to be subdivided into smaller parts (called modules), each of which must be as independent as possible from the application itself and from the remaining parts.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Software testing has several levels, including:
- Unit tests: Validate that each unit of software works as expected.
- Integration testing: Validates that software components or functions work
together.
- System testing: consists of testing the software in its entirety, that is, testing that all of
them work well together.
- Acceptance tests: verify whether the entire system works as intended, that is, as
specified in the requirements.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:
A version control system is a type of software that helps track changes made to code
over time. They are important because they help ensure that, as a developer edits the
code, the version control system takes a snapshot of the files which avoids having
multiple copies on your local computer.
Some examples of popular version control systems:
- GitHub: It is characterized by being a distributed repository model compatible with
existing systems and protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SSH and is capable of
efficiently handling small to large projects.
- CSV: It is characterized by being a client-server repository model where several
developers can work on the same project in parallel.
- Apache Subversion (SVN)– A client-server repository model where directories are
versioned along with copy, delete, move, and rename operations.
- Mercurial: Developed in python, it has high performance and scalability with
advanced branching and merging capabilities and fully distributed collaborative
development. In addition, it has an integrated web interface.
- Monotone- Written in C++, it is a tool for distributed version control. uses a very
efficient and robust custom protocol called Netsync

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintenance is the process by which a software product is modified after delivery
to correct errors, improve performance, or other attributes.
There are different types of maintenance activities; preventive, corrective, perfective and
adaptive.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
